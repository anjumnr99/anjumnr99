My expertise extends to both the client and server sides of development, utilizing technologies like Express.js and Node.js to manage server logic, MongoDB for data storage, and React to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. In essence, my role involves creating seamless and engaging web experiences by integrating design and functionality across the entire development stack.
